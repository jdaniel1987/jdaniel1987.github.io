If you've ever found your Program.cs file cluttered with endpoint mappings, you're not alone. As your API grows, this approach can become unwieldy, making your code harder to maintain.

Carter is a lightweight and flexible routing library for ASP.NET Core that simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs. It provides a straightforward way to define routes and handle HTTP requests, enabling developers to build APIs with less boilerplate code and improved maintainability.

## **Advantages of Carter**

- **Simplified Routing:** Carter streamlines route definitions, making it easier to manage and understand routing in your application. You can define routes using simple and intuitive syntax.
- **Reduced Boilerplate Code:** It minimizes the amount of boilerplate code required for setting up routes and handling HTTP requests, allowing you to focus more on your application's core logic.
- **Convention-Based Routing:** Carter uses convention-based routing, which simplifies the process of mapping endpoints to handlers. This reduces the need for repetitive code and promotes consistency.
- **Enhanced Readability:** The code structure is cleaner and more readable compared to traditional ASP.NET Core routing, thanks to its concise syntax and organizational patterns.
- **Built-In Support for Middleware:** Carter integrates seamlessly with ASP.NET Core middleware, allowing you to leverage the full power of the ASP.NET Core pipeline, including authentication, authorization, and error handling.
- **Strong Typing and Validation:** It provides strong typing for routes and parameters, which helps catch errors at compile time and improves code quality. Additionally, it supports model validation out of the box.
- **Scalability:** Carter is designed to scale with your application. Its modular approach allows you to manage and extend routes easily as your project grows.
- **Enhanced Testing:** The clear separation of route definitions and handlers makes it easier to write unit tests and integration tests for your API endpoints.
- **Integration with ASP.NET Core Features:** Carter works well with other ASP.NET Core features, such as dependency injection and configuration, allowing for a cohesive development experience.
- **Community and Support:** As an open-source project, Carter benefits from community contributions and support, providing access to a range of resources and solutions.

## **Examples of Usage**

### **1. Install the nuget package**

Begin by adding Carter to your project via NuGet. You can do this through Visual Studio: Right-click on your project -> Manage NuGet Packages... -> Browse, search for "Carter," select it, and click Install.

### **2. Review Your Current Endpoints**

Your endpoints are likely mapped directly in your Program.cs file, resembling something like this:

```c#
public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Services injection and other stuff

        app.MapGet("api/task", (HttpContext httpContext) =>
        {
            // .................... Logic
            return task;
        })
        .WithName("GetTask")
        .WithOpenApi();

        app.MapPost("api/task", (HttpContext httpContext) =>
        {
            // .................... Logic
            return task;
        })
        .WithName("PostTask")
        .WithOpenApi();
        // ....................................................................
    }
}
```

### **3. Create a Carter Module for each Endpoint** 
Replace your inline endpoints with modular Carter modules:
```c#
public class GetTaskModule : ICarterModule
{
    public void AddRoutes(IEndpointRouteBuilder app)
    {
        app.MapGet("api/task", (HttpContext httpContext) =>
        {
            // .................... Logic
            return task;
        })
        .WithName("GetTask")
        .WithOpenApi();
    }
}
```

```c#
public class AddTaskModule : ICarterModule
{
    public void AddRoutes(IEndpointRouteBuilder app)
    {
        app.MapPost("api/task", (HttpContext httpContext) =>
        {
            // .................... Logic
            return task;
        })
        .WithName("PostTask")
        .WithOpenApi();
    }
}
```

### **4. Remove the endpoints from program.cs** 
To avoid conflicts, delete the old endpoint mappings from your Program.cs file.

### **5. Register carter in program.cs** 
```c#
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

    
    builder.Services.AddCarter();
    // ....................
```

### **5. Map carter modules**
Finally, map Carter modules in your Program.cs to register all implementations of ICarterModule.
```c#
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    // ....................
    app.MapCarter();
    // ....................

    app.Run();
}    
```

Now, your endpoints are cleanly separated into modules, making your API easier to maintain and scale. Enjoy your streamlined development with Carter!
